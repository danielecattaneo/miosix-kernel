/*
 * System initialization code for RP2040
 * Partially based on code from the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK
 *
 * The RP2040 boot process consists of three stages:
 *  Stage 1: Bootloader in ROM does basic system initialization. If BOOTSEL is
 *           not set, loads stage 2 and jumps to it.
 *  Stage 2: Stored in the first 256 bytes of flash. Configures XIP peripheral
 *           for the specific FLASH chip used, then jumps to stage 3. Source
 *           code for stage 2 is in common/rp2040/pre_boot.
 *  Stage 3: This file.
 *
 * In Miosix we consider RP2040 stage 1 and stage 2 as "Miosix preboot".

/**
 * This function is the first function called during boot to initialize the
 * platform memory and clock subsystems.
 *
 * Code in this function has several important restrictions:
 * - When this function is called, part of the memory address space may not be
 *   available. This occurs when the board includes an external memory, and
 *   indeed it is the purpose of this very function to enable the external
 *   memory (if present) and map it into the address space!
 * - This function is called before global and static variables in .data/.bss
 *   are initialized. As a consequence, this function and all function it calls
 *   are forbidden from referencing global and static variables
 * - This function is called with the stack pointer pointing to the interrupt
 *   stack. This is in general a small stack, but is the only stack that is
 *   guaranteed to be in the internal memory. The allocation of stack-local
 *   variables and the nesting of function calls should be kept to a minimum
 * - This function is called with interrupts disabled, before the kernel is
 *   started and before the I/O subsystem is enabled. There is thus no way
 *   of printing any debug message.
 *
 * This function should perform the following operations:
 * - Configure the internal memory wait states to support the desired target
 *   operating frequency
 * - Configure the CPU clock (e.g: PLL) to run at the desired target frequency
 * - Enable and configure the external memory (if available)
 *
 * As a postcondition of running this function, the entire memory map as
 * specified in the linker script should be accessible, so the rest of the
 * kernel can use the memory to complete the boot sequence, and the CPU clock
 * should be configured at the desired target frequency so the boot can proceed
 * quickly.
